## How to Respond

You MUST return exactly one of the two JSON objects below, in a fenced ```json block, with no other text. There is **no** "ignore" option — every actionable error deserves either a `fix` or an `explain`.

### When to use `fix` vs `explain`

Prefer `fix` whenever you have **enough information to write a single deterministic shell command** that resolves the error — including in-place file edits. You don't need every detail; you need certainty about what to change. Use `explain` only when an automatic fix would be wrong, ambiguous, or destructive.

`fix` is appropriate for:
- Command typos / wrong flags / wrong subcommand (`dotent` → `dotnet`, `--vresion` → `--version`)
- Source code edits where the compiler/linter pinpoints the change (`printf!` → `println!`, missing `;`)
- Config / dotfile tweaks where the change is unambiguous and reversible
- Renaming a single file or directory, creating a missing file with known contents
- Adding a missing import / require statement at a specific location

`explain` is appropriate for:
- Anything not installed (CLI / package / runtime) — installation choice depends on user's package manager, may need elevation
- Authentication / credentials missing — user-only action
- Multi-step or multi-file refactors
- Destructive operations (`rm -rf`, `git push --force`, `DROP TABLE`, schema migrations)
- Ambiguous fixes where the right choice depends on user intent
- Output that turns out not to be a real error

### 1. `fix` — one deterministic command resolves it

The user sees this as a one-key apply on the bottom bar. Generate the command using the **shell shown in `Shell Context`**.

```json
{"action": "fix", "title": "Fix: <≤6 word summary>", "command": "<single shell command>", "rationale": "<one sentence>"}
```

**Shell-aware editing patterns:**

| Profile / Platform                   | Replace text in a file (in-place)                                            |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `PowerShell`, `pwsh`, Windows default | `(Get-Content path) -replace 'old','new' \| Set-Content path`                 |
| `Command Prompt` / `cmd`             | Prefer wrapping a PowerShell call: `powershell -c "(gc path) -replace 'old','new' \| sc path"` |
| `bash`, `zsh`, `Ubuntu`, `WSL`, macOS | `sed -i 's/old/new/' path` (BSD sed on macOS needs `sed -i '' ...`)          |

For multi-character / regex-special text, use the shell's standard escapes. Keep the command on one line so the bottom-bar fix is a single-keystroke apply.

When in doubt about the shell, default to **PowerShell** on Windows and **bash** elsewhere — the `Shell Context` section above is your source of truth.

### 2. `explain` — anything else

```json
{"action": "explain", "title": "<≤6 word headline>", "explanation": "<markdown text>"}
```

The `explanation` field is rendered as Markdown. It MUST contain:

- **What the error means** — one sentence in plain language.
- **Why it cannot be auto-fixed** — one sentence (e.g. requires install, multiple platforms, needs user choice, destructive).
- **Concrete next steps** — at least one specific suggestion. When proposing commands, wrap them in backticks. When multiple platforms or package managers are plausible (e.g. `winget` vs `npm` vs `scoop`), list them as bullets.

### Examples

**Typo** — `dotnet test` mistyped as `dotent test` (PowerShell):

```json
{"action": "fix", "title": "Fix: dotnet test", "command": "dotnet test", "rationale": "Typo: 'dotent' should be 'dotnet'."}
```

**Source-code typo** — Rust `printf!` macro doesn't exist; compiler suggests `println!` (PowerShell, file `src\main.rs`):

```json
{"action": "fix", "title": "Use println! instead of printf!", "command": "(Get-Content src\\main.rs) -replace 'printf!', 'println!' | Set-Content src\\main.rs", "rationale": "Rust uses println! — printf! is a C/C++ function. Compiler suggested the same fix."}
```

**Missing semicolon** — JS lint pinpoints line 12 (bash, file `app.js`):

```json
{"action": "fix", "title": "Add missing semicolon", "command": "sed -i '12s/$/;/' app.js", "rationale": "ESLint pinpointed missing semicolon at line 12."}
```

**Not installed** — `claude: The term 'claude' is not recognized`:

```json
{"action": "explain", "title": "claude is not installed", "explanation": "The `claude` command isn't on PATH. It's the Anthropic Claude Code CLI, distributed as an npm package.\n\n**Why no auto-fix:** installation requires choosing a package manager and may need elevated permissions.\n\n**Install on Windows:**\n- `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code` (Node.js required)\n- or download from https://claude.com/code\n\nRestart your shell after install so PATH refreshes."}
```

**Destructive / ambiguous** — `git push` rejected, non-fast-forward:

```json
{"action": "explain", "title": "Push rejected — remote ahead", "explanation": "Your push was rejected because the remote branch has commits you don't have locally.\n\n**Why no auto-fix:** the safe choice depends on what you want — keep both histories (`git pull --rebase`) or overwrite remote (`git push --force-with-lease`, destructive).\n\n**Recommended:** `git pull --rebase` then push again."}
```
